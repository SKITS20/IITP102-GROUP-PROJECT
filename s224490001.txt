THE “IDEA”

We have come to a decision to come up with an application that will provide a user to explore a human body diagram which are male, female and transgenders. These diagrams will be displayed for a user to click a certain part in the body which will then provide all the possible sicknesses or injuries that an unsure user may be able to identify. For example, if the user is experiencing a headache, a user will have to click a head in the human body diagram which will then show all the possible health issues in that certain part of the body, after the user has clicked the most similar health issue he or she may be experiencing, the user will be then suggested or recommended with the most outstanding medicines or pills that may be able to cure the problem. If the user is unsure of what to choose at this stage, the user will have an alternative to get contacts and locations of the nearest clinics, hospitals or health advisors. IF by chance the user may have experience a low-risk injuries like sprained ankle and does not want to go to a doctor, a user will be provided with set of instructions with health expert verified videos which they can follow at home.
